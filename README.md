# Object-Oriented-C-Plus-Plus-Chinese-Chess-Game

This is a Chinese Chess game (Xiangqi) which I created for my final project in the Object Oriented Programming in C++ course at Manchester. 

The requirement of the project was to be standard C++ (e.g. no external libraries) and to make use of advanced object-oriented programming features (at least inheritance and polymorphism). 

The rules for the game can be found on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi.
